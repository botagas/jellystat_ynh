This installation script will provide you with a default admin user and a randomly generated password.

This does not support SSO or LDAP and is intended for local use only. External expore is not advised.

Make sure to do proper backups of the whole instance as well as the apps and data within Yunohost. Installs can always break something, so be prepared.
